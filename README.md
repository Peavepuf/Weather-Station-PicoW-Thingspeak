Pico W Weather Station is an open-source project designed in micropython to monitor and collect various environmental parameters using Pico W microcontroller. This weather station is equipped with sensors for measuring wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. The project aims to provide a compact, affordable, and efficient solution for gathering weather-related data.

Features
Wind Speed and Direction: Precisely measures the speed and direction of the wind using dedicated sensors.
Temperature and Humidity: Monitors ambient temperature and humidity levels for accurate weather readings.
Soil Moisture: Tracks the moisture content in the soil for agricultural and gardening applications.
Light Intensity: Measures the intensity of light, useful for various environmental analyses.
